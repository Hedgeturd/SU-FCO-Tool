# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Usage
As simple as dragging and dropping the supported file formats onto the executable<br>

Text can be modified by placing translated text into the XML using [HedgeHex](https://github.com/NextinMono/HedgeHex)<br>
Text properties can also be modified by changing the values inside the XML<br>

## To Do
- Add support for extra FCO text features<br>
- Clean up the project code and files
