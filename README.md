# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Using the tool
As simple as dragging and dropping the supported file formats onto the executable<br>

## Editing
Text can be modified by placing translated text into the XML using HedgeHex<br>
Text properties can also be modified by changing the values inside the XML<br>

## Limitations
At this moment in time, the tool is only able to convert basic FCO files<br>
It does not yet have support for writing highlights and other extra FCO text features

## Thanks
Big thank you to TheExentist151 for letting me recycle some of the code from the SonicColorsXTBConv Tool which can be found here:<br>
