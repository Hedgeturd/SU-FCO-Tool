# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Using the tool
As simple as dragging and dropping supported file formats

At this moment in time, the tool is only able to convert basic FCO files<br>
It does not yet have support for writing highlights and other extra FCO text features

## Thanks
Big thank you to TheExentist151 for letting me recycle some of the code from the SonicColorsXTBConv Tool which can be found here:<br>
