# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Usage
As simple as dragging and dropping the supported file formats onto the executable<br>

Text can be modified by placing translated text into the XML using [HedgeHex](https://github.com/NextinMono/HedgeHex)<br>
Text properties can also be modified by changing the values inside the XML<br>

## To Do
- Add Hex to Symbol translator
- Merge HedgeHex translator into the tool
- Clean up the project code and files

## Thanks
Big thank you to [TheExentist151](https://github.com/TheExentist151) for letting me recycle some of the code from [SonicColorsXTBConv](https://github.com/TheExentist151/SonicColorsXTBConv)<br>
and thank you to [NextinHKRY](https://github.com/NextinMono) for general coding help

## Requirements
If the tool does nothing when dragging files onto the executable you may need to download the [.NET Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win10-x64&apphost_version=7.0.14) package that the tool needs to work
