# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Using the tool
As simple as dragging and dropping supported file formats\n
At this moment in time, the tool is only able to convert basic FCO files\n
It does not yet have support for writing highlights and other extra FCO text features\n

## Thanks
Big thank you to TheExentist151 for letting me recycle some of the code from the SonicColorsXTBConv Tool which can be found here:
