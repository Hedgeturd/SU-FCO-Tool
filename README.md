# Sonic Unleashed FCO Tool
A tool to convert Unleashed FCO files into XML files and vice versa

## Usage
As simple as dragging and dropping the supported file formats onto the executable<br>

Text can be modified by placing translated text into the XML using HedgeHex<br>
Text properties can also be modified by changing the values inside the XML<br>

## Limitations
The tool is only able to convert basic FCO files<br>
Highlights and other extra FCO text features are not yet supported

## Thanks
Big thank you to [TheExentist151](https://github.com/TheExentist151) for letting me recycle some of the code from [SonicColorsXTBConv](https://github.com/TheExentist151/SonicColorsXTBConv)
